@protobuf-ts/test-generated
===========================

Automated tests for code generated by the protobuf-ts plugin. 

| Test name     | optimize_for  | 64 bit number representation  |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| speed         | speed         |                        string |
| size          | code size     |                        string |
| speed-bigint  | speed         |                        bigint |
| size-bigint   | code size     |                        bigint |


Each test validates:
- the special JSON representation of well-known-types
- injected utility methods like `Timestamp.toDate()`
- compatibility of binary encoding via reflection and via generated code
- binary and JSON format conformance, using googles [conformance test runner](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/3.12.x/conformance/README.md) 

`@protobuf-ts/runtime` and `@protobuf-ts/plugin` must be built to run the 
tests. `make` executes all tests. See `Makefile` for details.
